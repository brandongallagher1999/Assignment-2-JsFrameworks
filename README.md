# How to run
## Docker
1. Download Docker for Desktop (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Container
1. Go into root folder and run
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
  
## Opening Web App
1. Go into any browser, preferably Google Chrome
2. In the URL bar, type "localhost:3000"
3. Auth0 broke, so you have to go to localhost:3000/test for CRUD operations.

## Auth0
I tried using every form of authentication and Auth0 looked good but its still broken like every other form of auth on Express.
